HTML: This is the structure of the game. It includes elements like buttons for the player to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and areas to display the choices made by the player and the computer, as well as the result of each round.

CSS: This is used to style the HTML elements, making the game visually appealing. It includes things like colors, fonts, and layout design.

JavaScript: This is the programming language used to make the game interactive. It includes functions to handle player input, generate random choices for the computer, determine the winner of each round based on the choices made, and update the game display accordingly.

When the player clicks on a button to choose rock, paper, or scissors, the JavaScript code generates a random choice for the computer, compares it with the player's choice, determines the winner, and updates the display to show the result. The game continues until the player decides to stop or play again.
